###Greetings!
This repo houses several stand-alone programs that are written in Ruby - mostly to solve various small programming challenges. Since I'm a relatively new programmer, this helps me review and practice using methods available to specific classes - e.g., the [Date](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/date/rdoc/Date.html) and [Prime](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.0/libdoc/prime/rdoc/Prime.html) classes, not to mention the all-important [Array](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html) and [String](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.1/String.html) classes.

I've realized (belatedly) that some of my earlier solutions might not be very user-readable, or that they might benefit from some light commenting. I'm keeping this in mind as I forge ahead...

####tictactoe.rb
Run `ruby tictactoe.rb` from your command line to enjoy a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

Play against another human or play against an arrogant computer adversary; play on a conventional 3x3 board or play on a 4x4 board.

**N.B. This game is undergoing an overhaul while I read Sandi Metz's [*POODR*](http://www.poodr.com/). Its new incarnation lives in a separate repo - follow-along [here!](https://github.com/eirinikos/modular-tictactoe)**

####_codewars.rb
This contains most of my recent solutions for Codewars katas.
(My user profile is [here](http://www.codewars.com/users/eirinikos).)
Some of the solutions have been refactored (after examining other Codewars users' solutions), while others have been left as-is (i.e., written at a low-level).

####_project_euler.rb
This comprises my wee collection of Project Euler solutions.

####_reddit_dailyprogrammer.rb
This comprises a new collection of solutions for challenges hosted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer).

####number_guess.rb
Run `ruby number_guess.rb` to see what this one does (or, just read the comments).

####cracklepop.rb
Run `ruby cracklepop.rb` to see what this one does (or, just read the comments).
